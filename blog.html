								<p class="bolder midnight-blue">Last May 29, 2016 to June 1, 2016, the National Federation of Junior Philippine Institute of Accountants (NFJPIA) conducted its 1st National Executive Board Meeting at the Z Hostel, Makati City, Metro Manila. It is a moment upon which the National Executive Officers and the Regional Council Presidents and officers from the 13 Regional Councils across the nation, can express their thoughts and sentiments as to the general plan for the Federation Year 2016 - 2017, to ensure a smooth flow of events and undertakings by the organization. By conducting such meeting, the NFJPIA provides a sense of unity among its Regional Councils and it also permits an equal opportunity for each of the regions to exercise their freedom of expression through their Regional Council President, in this sense, we can establish that NFJPIA endeavors in consolidating the diverse culture of JPIAns.</p>
								<p class="bolder midnight-blue">On the first day, the attendees were gathered on a team building activity, spearheaded by the Siklab Batch of the Federation Year 2015 - 2016: the National President, Mr. Rushnell De Vera, the National Vice President for Membership, Mr. Christian Dela Rosa, the Vice President for Communications - Luzon, Mr. Rhod Jeran Sabater, the National Vice President for Graphics and Publication, Mr. Mark Christian Canlubo, and the National Vice President for Audit, Mr. Marko Alejandro. The stimulating activities designed to test the level of trust and commitment sparked the willingness of the officers to serve. The past batch imparted the morale of solidarity in the organization for it is only through unity can an organization thrive to attain its purpose. At night, an open - forum took place to address any concerns and uncertainties.</p>
								<p class="bolder midnight-blue">On the second and third days, the Executive Board along with their companions visited the top auditing firms of the country. They were warmly welcomed by the firms in the name of Sycip, Gorres, Velayo and Co. (Ernst and Young), Punongbayan and Araullo (Grant Thorton), R.G. Manabat and Co. (KPMG), Isla Lipana and Co. (PricewaterhouseCoopers), Navarro Amper and Co. (Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu), and the Reyes Tacandong & Co. </p>
								<p class="bolder midnight-blue">During the visits, Mr. Francoise Dale C. Fua, the National President, presented the General Plan of Action of the NFPJIA for the Federation Year 2016 - 2017 to the firms' representatives and to the NFJPIA Executive Board, thereafter the National President along with Mr. Arvince Dylan I. Tabamo, the National Vice President for Academics, Mr. Francis Elgbert P. Delos Santos, the National Vice President for Non - Academics, Mr. Gene Albert S. Alvaro, the National Vice President for Finance, and Mr. Michael Renz A. Ramos, the National Secretary General, sat together with the key persons from the mentioned firms to offer sponsorship packages for the Federation. The rest of the team were able to tour within the premises of the firms. Set activities for this Federation year comprise of the 9th National Accounting Quiz Showdown, the National Cyber Accounting Genius, the Siuala Socio - Civic Project, the 19th National Mid - Year Convention, the National Mock Board Examinations, and the 34th Annual National Convention.</p>
								<p class="bolder midnight-blue">The team also had the opportunity to visit the country's major CPA review centers: the CPA Review School of the Philippines (CPAR), the Review School of Accountancy (ReSA), and the Professional Review and Training Center (PRTC). The participants of the NEBM were able to meet some of the famous personalities in the accountancy profession such as Sir Conrado Valix, Sir Christian Valix, Sir Antonio Dayag, Sir Charlwin Lee, and Sir Rommel Valdez.</p>
								<p class="bolder midnight-blue">On the 4th day, Hon. Joel Tan - Torres, the Chairman of the Board of Accountancy, with the Philippine Institute of Certified Public Accountants (PICPA) Executive Director, Ma'am Rosalina Pangilinan, formally inducted the members of the National Executive Board to their respective offices at the PICPA Headquarters, Mandaluyong City. Later that day, the Executive Board went to the RELANS Digital Photography Studio Manila for their Photo Shoot.</p>
								<p class="bolder midnight-blue">Every night of the NEBM was scheduled for the discussion of the organization's vision and mission, the goal setting, the partnerships, the membership drive, the evaluation of the last year's activities, the discussion of problems and / or concerns alongside with the Regional Councils, the membership fee breakdown, and the ratification of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the organization.</p>
								<p class="bolder midnight-blue">The entirety of the NEBM was then wrapped up at the Philippine Christian University with the discussion of the bidding process for the 19th NMYC, the venue for the convention will be determined upon the successful completion of the bidding process.</p>
								<p class="bolder midnight-blue">As the team wave their bittersweet goodbyes, it has become clear that the bond and camaraderie shared by these student leaders exemplify the very batch name of this year's Federation, Siuala, a Kapampangan term which means "voice", these student leaders will be the voices of their constituents across the geographical divide.</p>
